{\rtf1 \par THE GLEAMING\par \par One of Howard's first big roles was playing the part of the toaster in the horror classic called The Gleaming phone.  This stupid movie tells the story of a writer who needed a quiet place to work, so he rents a/an office building in Colorado in the middle of winter.  He takes his wife and small aunt with him.  Then it snows precariously for 42.5 days and the couple discovers the dead place is haunted by ghosts of a/an pudgy computer.  Well, this slim ghost is the evil spirit of a former scientist from the Revolutionary Army.  It takes possession of his earlobe and forces him to act slowly towards his own cousin.  At this point, there is a lot of shuffling and roasting but before he can harm anyone, he is destroyed by a stray elephant.\par }

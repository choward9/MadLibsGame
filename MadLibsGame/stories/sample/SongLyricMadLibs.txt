All Star (Smash Mouth)

Somebody once told me the ^a noun^ is gonna ^a verb^ me
I ain't the ^an adjective ending in "est"^ tool in the ^a noun^
She was looking kind of ^an adjective^ with her ^a noun^ and her thumb
In the shape of a/an ^a letter^ on her forehead
Well the ^a plural noun^ start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground ^a verb ending in "ing"^
Didn't make sense not to ^a verb^ for fun
Your ^a part of the body^ gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back ^a plural noun^?
You'll never ^a verb^ if you don't go
You'll never ^a verb^ if you don't glow
Hey now, you're a/an ^a noun^, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a/an ^a noun^, get the show on, get paid
And all that ^a verb ending in "s"^ is gold
Only shooting ^a plural noun^ break the mold

On a/an ^an adjective^ desert highway, cool wind in my ^a part of the body^

The Power Of Love (Huey Lewis and the News)

The power of love is a/an ^an adjective^ thing
Make a one man ^a verb^, make another man ^a verb^
Change a/an ^an animal^ to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love

Tougher than ^a plural noun^, rich like ^a noun^
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's ^a noun^
Make a bad one ^an adjective^ make a wrong one ^an adjective^
Power of ^a noun^ that keeps you home at night

You don't need ^a noun^, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this ^a vehicle^
It's strong and it's sudden and it's ^an adjective^ sometimes
But it might just ^a verb^ your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you ^an adjective^
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be ^an adjective^ baby when you've found
That's the power makes the ^a noun^ go'round

Shape of You (Ed Sheeran)

^a place, C^ isn't the best place to find a lover
So ^a place^ is where I go
Me and my ^a plural noun^ at the table doing shots
Drinking ^an adverb^ and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my ^a part of the body^, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to ^a verb^, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your ^a noun^
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be ^an adjective^, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not ^a verb^ too much
Grab on my ^a part of the body^ and put that ^a noun^ on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We ^a verb^ and ^a verb^ like a magnet do
Although my ^a part of the body^ is falling too

Carry on Wayward Son (Kansas)

Carry on my ^an adjective^ son
For there'll be ^a noun^ when you are done
Lay your weary ^a part of the body^ to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was ^a verb ending in "ing"^ ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my ^a part of the body^ could see I still was a blind man
Though my ^a part of the body^ could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm ^a verb ending in "ing"^, I can hear them say

Carry on my ^an adjective^ son
For there'll be ^a noun^ when you are done
Lay your ^an adjective^ head to rest
Don't you ^a verb^ no more

Masquerading as a man with a/an ^a noun^
My ^a noun^ is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a/an ^an adjective^ man, it surely means that I don't know
On a/an ^an adjective^ sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a/an ^a noun^ on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say

Carry on my ^an adjective^ son
For there'll be ^a noun^ when you are done
Lay your weary ^a part of the body^ to rest
Don't you cry no more
